Summary thesis:

Hurricane Katrina, Harvey, Irma and the 2010 and 2015 earthquakes in Haiti and Nepal is only a
small enumeration of the natural disasters with a sudden onset in the past years. These disasters
occur in different parts of the world, in countries developed and undeveloped, small and large. They
shape the political agenda and based on historical trends this will only increase.
Airports are a special critical infrastructure in a disaster response from a resilience point of view.
They must overcome two types of shocks when they are affected by a disaster. They are not only
hit by a disaster, which decreases their performances. Airports also need to act as a humanitarian
and logistic hub for the disaster response which leads to an influx of aircraft. This influx requires
the airport to increase their normal performance. In this research a mesoscopic model is built to
compare different policies that can improve the resilience of the operations of airports during the
immediate post disaster response. This problem is stated in the following main research question:
How should airport services be improved to be more resilient during the immediate post disaster
response?

This study uses a mesoscopic discrete event model to capture the airport system. The mesoscopic
characteristics of this model makes it adaptable to different airports and different natural sudden
onset disasters. The mesoscopic model is divided into three model components: (1) gate selection,
(2) aircraft unloading and (3) warehouse operations. By using the mesoscopic view, the lowest level
of detail that is sufficient to perform analysis on is used. The following six policies are compared
in this study: extra resources, prioritize on aircraft size, prioritize on cargo type, extra warehouses,
extra holding area and a combined policy. These policies affect different components of the system
and are tested for four scenarios with different percentages of loose cargo and different percentages
of workers that won’t show up after a disaster occurs

To compare the effect of the policies on the level of resilience of the system, this study proposes
a new resilient measurement approach that incorporates the bounce back and bounce up capacity of
a system. This approach divides resilience into three aspects (1) absorption capacity, (2) adaptive
capacity and (3) recovery time. This resilience measurement approach can be used when a system
has the following two characteristics: (1) dynamic required service levels over time and (2) internal
system changes.

To measure the resilience of the airport system, the three aspects of resilience are measured over
all three model components for the three KPI’s of the airport system: (1) processed cargo, (2) idle
cargo and (3) throughput time.

The new resilient measurement approach that incorporates the bounce back and bounce up capacity
of a system creates insight in processes and problems within airports in humanitarian logistics
in the immediate response phase. This approach reveals the intertwinement of the system components.
Policies that improve the level of resilience of the system affect multiple components and KPIs
at once. Further studies about airports in humanitarian logistics in the immediate response phase
should take this intertwinement of the system into account and should study the airport system as
a holistic whole.

The answer of the main research questions is the advice that a policy maker should implement the
combined policy as soon after the disaster occurs independent of the scenario the system is facing.

This includes ordered on level of importance: (1) ask aid organization and/or the military for extra
resources and emphasize the need for a quick arrival of these resources, (2) ask aid organizations
for mobile storage units, (3) create extra holding capacity and (4) implement a prioritization policy
on cargo type and aircraft size. By following these steps, the airport has the best change to stay
operational.

The external effects have a large influence on the effect of the policies. The operations of the
airport are influenced by two major external effect: (1) the percentage of loose cargo and (2) the
percentage of workers that does not show up. The first effect can be minimized by emphasizing
the negative effect of loose cargo to the humanitarian air cargo operators. If the humanitarian air
cargo operators minimize the percentage of loose cargo, the airport can handle faster and more
cargo. The second effect can be overcome by organizing upfront specialized extra workers that can
act as a backup pool when the planned workers do not show up. These extra workers can come
from the military as well from aid organizations like DHL. Theses extra workers minimize the performance
loss of the airport and result in the effect that the airport can handle faster and more cargo.
